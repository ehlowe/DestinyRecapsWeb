const essay = `Status Quo:     
The vast majority of consumed media content comes from a small slice of the content available and usually in a fashion to maximize consumption. If this wasn't the case, with current systems, the content provided would be far less attractive or useful.

Problems:       
This feeding method causes two big issues: you lose the context on most of what is happening and your time is being governed by a filter that doesn't care about you or understand what you would say you want. This isn't the case for all media but it is the current paradigm, the algorithms only understand and care about what you do.

Solution:
Can a system be built to present a condensed version of a longer context, so that someone could grab the gist and guide themselves toward their interest if any from the content? Would that be valuable and or fix some of the current issues?`;
